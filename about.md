# About HPC Carpentry

HPC Carpentry is a set of publicly available teaching materials designed to make the 
task of teaching HPC a little easier.  These lessons are specifically aimed at academic
researchers who are new to the task of using remote, large-scale computing (see [Why 
HPC Carpentry](why-hpc-carpentry)).  

The HPC Carpentry lessons have been developed for instructors 
looking to teach introductory workshops on high-performance computing.
Lessons follow the Carpentries format: 
all teaching is done via live coding, 
with students following along with the instructor on their own computer.
No prior experience is required, 
and the workshop itself requires only a half day (at minimum) commitment from 
instructors and attendees, although we recommend running at least day-long or two-day 
workshops to accommodate the amount of content and respect the pace of learning.  
Students should be able to leave the workshop and immediately begin working on an HPC system.

## Using the materials and name

Anyone is welcome to use, remix and share the HPC Carpentry lesson materials for their 
own purposes.  

If you want to run a workshop under the "HPC Carpentry" name, 
we ask that workshop organizers follow these guidelines: 

* Use the [Carpentries][carpentries] teaching mode of live-coding instruction and hands-on learning
* Run the workshop under the [Carpentries Code of Conduct][carpentries-coc]
* Have at least one Carpentries-certified instructor
* Teach at least the [hpc-intro][] lesson module, as well as any other [hpc-carpentry][] modules of your choice

## Get in touch!  

We would like to track workshops that use this material (whether officially branded as 
HPC Carpentry or not).  Please fill out the following forms: 

* [Before a workshop][pre-workshop]
	* Let us know if you're interested in running a workshop (or planning to give one), 
	and if you have any questions
* [After a workshop][post-workshop]
	* Provide feedback about what materials you used and how it went

There is also an [HPC Carpentry mailing list hosted on Topicbox][hpc-list] -- sign up
