                        <p>
                        HPC Carpentry is a set of teaching materials designed to help new users take advantage of high-performance computing systems. 
                        No prior computational experience is required - 
                        these lessons are ideal for either an interactive workshop or independent study.

                    <h2>What is HPC Carpentry?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Each of these lessons are designed to teach how to interact with a compute cluster in a specific way.
                    The first lesson, <a href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/">Intro to HPC</a>, 
                    is a general introduction to the bash command line and submitting jobs on a typical HPC cluster. 
                    The second two lessons focus on two separate use cases for HPC: 
                    running large numbers of compute jobs (often with complex inter-job dependencies),
                    or creating parallel programs that execute across one or more compute nodes.
                    Each lesson takes roughly a full day to teach (or work through independently), 
                    and it is intended that the Intro to HPC lesson be taught together with either the 
                    Python or Chapel component to form a two-day workshop. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Workshops are intended to be fully interactive and taught in the 
                    <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">"Software Carpentry"</a>-format:
                    instruction is done live, with learners coding along with workshop instructors.
                    Frequent excercises and test problems have been added to ensure students have a chance to try things on their own. 
                    No prior computing experience is required or expected.
                    </p>
