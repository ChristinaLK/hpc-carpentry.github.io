# About HPC Carpentry

HPC Carpentry is not an organization - 
it is merely a set of publicly available teaching materials designed to make the task of teaching HPC a little easier.
We welcome all contributions, in particular adaptations of our Intro to HPC lesson for other schedulers besides SLURM.
