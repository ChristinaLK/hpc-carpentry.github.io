# Why HPC Carpentry?

HPC Carpentry's materials were developed to address 
the relative lack of introductory materials for high-performance computing environments, 
including, but not limited to supercomputers, campus clusters, distributed high throughput 
systems and cloud computing.  
Most materials currently available either assume a certain level of prerequisite knowledge,
or are in the wrong format for introductory workshops 
(either lecture-based or have a very long teaching time).
Until recently, the best option for teaching basic workshops on remote, large-scale  
compute resources was to teach one of the popular [Software Carpentry][swc] workshops, 
with a brief HPC component tacked on or crammed into various sections. 
This was not a good solution in most cases - 
Software Carpentry's materials are already more or less "full" 
(something added comes at the expense of something else),
and the languages/topics of the workshops 
was not particularly well matched for problems commonly encountered in HPC
(for instance, hardcore number crunching or execution of large numbers of externally 
written programs and tools).

See [About HPC Carpentry](about) for information about HPC Carpentry in general
and [Running a workshop](workshops) for details about how to run your own HPC 
Carpentry workshop.  

Instructors simply looking to teach basic programming skills in R or Python 
are highly encouraged to check out the materials offered by 
[Software Carpentry][swc].
Software Carpentry's lessons are more generally applicable 
introductory programming materials that do not have an HPC component.
