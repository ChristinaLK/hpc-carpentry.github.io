# Why HPC Carpentry?

HPC Carpentry's materials were developed to address 
the relative lack of introductory materials for high-performance computing environments.
Most materials currently available either assume a certain level of prerequisite knowledge,
or are in the wrong format for introductory workshops 
(either lecture-based or had a very long teaching time).
Until recently, the best option for teaching basic workshops on HPC 
was to teach one of the popular Software Carpentry workshops, 
with a brief HPC component tacked on or crammed into various sections. 
This was not a good solution in most cases - 
Software Carpentry's materials are already more or less "full" 
(something added comes at the expense of something else),
and the languages/topics of the workshops 
was not particularly well matched for problems commonly encountered in HPC
(hardcore number crunching and execution of large numbers of externally written programs and tools).

The HPC Carpentry lessons have been developed for instructors 
looking to teach introductory workshops on high-performance computing.
Lessons follow the Software Carpentry format: 
all teaching is done via live coding, 
with students following along with the instructor on their own computer.
No prior experience is required, 
and the workshop itself requires only a two-day committment from instructors and attendees.Students should be able to leave the workshop and immediately begin working on an HPC system.

Instructors simply looking to teach basic programming skills in R or Python 
are highly encouraged to check out the materials offered by 
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
Software Carpentry's lessons are more generally applicable materials that do not have an HPC component.
